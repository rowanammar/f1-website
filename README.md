# F1 Portal

Welcome to **F1 Portal** â€“ a fun and interactive website built to celebrate the thrill of Formula One racing! I created this site as a hands-on project to learn React and bring the excitement of F1 to life.

## What You'll Find

- **Driver Cards:**  
  Browse through profiles of F1 drivers, each with a unique team color, a cool picture, and extra details (like their racing number) revealed when you flip the card.

- **3D Animated Circuits:**  
  Enjoy a carousel of F1 tracks that spins like a merry-go-round. Hover over any circuit to get a quick peek at details about the track.

- **Races & Standings:**  
  Stay in the loop with up-to-date race information and standings, all fetched in real-time using the Ergast API.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  Whether you're on a desktop or your phone, the site adjusts beautifully to any screen size.

## Built With

- **React:** For building the interactive user interface.
- **CSS & Animations:** To create smooth, engaging animations and a clean look.
